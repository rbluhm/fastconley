# fastconley 0.3.0.9000

Development build for testing a faster spatial HAC path.

## Spatial meat changes

- Adds a `FastSpatialMeat()` internal Rcpp routine.
- Replaces dense `n x n` spatial distance matrices in `vcovSpHAC()` with a screened spatial edge list.
- Computes the meat via cumulative scores: `S = e * X`, `C_i = 0.5 S_i + sum_j w_ij S_j`, and `S'C + C'S`.
- Supports both `kernel = "bartlett"` and `kernel = "uniform"`.
- Supports `dist_fn` choices: haversine, spherical, chord. The upstream `flatearth` option was dropped — its formula was not symmetric in `(i, j)` and the equirectangular approximation is no longer worth a separate code path now that spherical+uniform runs as a 3D dot-product threshold with no trig.
- In balanced panels, builds one spatial edge list from the first period and reuses it for all periods.

## Performance work (most recent)

- **Templated `(dist_fn, kernel)` dispatch.** The screen + distance + kernel-weight stack is specialised at compile time for each of the six `(distance, kernel)` combinations, removing per-pair runtime branches.
- **3D unit-vector threshold for spherical and chord.** `(spherical, uniform)` pair inclusion now reduces to a 3D dot product compared against `cos(cutoff / R)` — no trig in the inner loop. `(chord, uniform)` uses squared-Euclidean against `(cutoff / R)²`. The `bartlett` variants only pay `acos`/`sqrt` on accepted pairs.
- **Row-major score buffer.** Scores `s_i = e_i · X_i` are stored row-major in a single flat `std::vector<double>` instead of being recomputed against column-major Armadillo memory on every pair.
- **Sorted-order layout.** Both the coordinate cache and the scores buffer are permuted into latitude-sorted order before the meat workers run, so every read in the hot loop is sequential — independent of how the caller laid out the input.
- **`pixel` argument** for score pre-aggregation (`R/vcovSpHAC.R`). At `pixel = 0` rows that share `(lat, lon)` within a time period are collapsed exactly; at `pixel > 0` rows are first snapped to a uniform `pixel`-km grid (speed/accuracy trade-off).
- Cross-section vs `fixest::vcov_conley` (`kernel = "uniform"`, spherical, 500 km cutoff): `fastconley` is now 3-4× faster at `pixel = 0` and 27-62× faster at `pixel = 25` across `n ∈ {5k … 100k}`, and scales better than fixest past 4 threads.

## Notes

- This is meant as a test branch/source drop, not a CRAN-ready release.
- The implementation uses RcppParallel for CSR construction and meat accumulation.
- Rcpp exports were updated manually. Running `Rcpp::compileAttributes()` is recommended after further edits.
